# Model-free & Learning-free robotic grasping

## About

GraspLoCoMo is a C++ software package used for robotic grasp generation. It allows to generate grasps for parallel jaw-grippers given a 3D point cloud with normals. This implementation is based on the results from the publication [Model-free and learning-free grasping by Local Contact Moment matching](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/267309469.pdf).

## Installation

### Software Requirements
GraspLoCoMo requires the following software:

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
  
and the following mandatory libraries
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/)
* [Nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann)

**Note** Eigen and Nanoflann are headers-only libraries and can be easily integrated using CMake. Please, download the requirements from each link and follow the instructions below the compile the code.

**Windows:** 
Install Visual Studio and CMake. Clone/Download Eigen and Nanoflann in the **_ThirdParty_** folder. 
In the CMakeLists.txt file, change the value of the variables _EIGEN3_INCLUDE_ and _NANO_FLANN_INCLUDE_ to the path of Eigen and Nanoflann.
Open CMake and configure the project.

```
**Where is the source code** : <Location of GraspLoCoMo>
**Where to build the binaries** : <Location of GraspLoCoMo>/Build	
```
Click on **Configure** and use the following configuration.

```
**Specify the generator for this project** : <Your installed version of visual studio>	
**Optional platform for generator ...** : x64
```
Click on **Finish**. The project can now be generated by clicking on **Generate**. 
The _Build_ folder will contain the Visual Studio solution of the project (GraspLoCoMo.sln).
Open the solution using Visual Studio and set the **TestdxGraspLoCoMo** as StartUp Project. Select **Release**, **x64** if not already set. And click run to execute the code.

**_Note (Release mode):_** By default the project will be in Debug mode. For some reason the execution of the code is much slower in this mode, set the poject to Release to get better performances. This will be fixed in future!!

**_Note for Linux:_** The code has not been tested on Linux, but should work with minor changes. The above procedure still applies.
